      <LegalSection id="information-we-collect" title="1. Information We Collect">
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20 }}>
          <li><strong>Account information.</strong> When you sign in with GitHub, we receive and store your email address, GitHub user ID, and GitHub username. We do not store passwords — sign-in is handled through GitHub OAuth.</li>
          <li><strong>Repository information.</strong> For repositories you connect, we store repository names and metadata, scan results (detected third-party API usage, dependency versions, and reliability findings), and the issues/alerts derived from them. We fetch source file contents only to perform a scan; scan results are stored, not the full file contents.</li>
          <li><strong>Provider connection metadata.</strong> When you connect an API provider (for example OpenAI or GitHub), we store the provider name, connection status, a masked identifier, and metadata about usage, quota, and rate-limit snapshots.</li>
          <li><strong>API credentials.</strong> Provider API keys and GitHub access tokens you authorize are encrypted before being stored (Fernet, AES-128-CBC with HMAC). Full credentials are never returned to the browser and never exposed in URLs, emails, or logs.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage information.</strong> We store snapshots of usage and rate-limit data for connected providers, alert delivery records, and email preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Logs.</strong> We keep limited diagnostic logs (for example error traces) to operate and debug the service. Credentials and secrets are never written to these logs.</li>
          <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> The application does not use tracking cookies. See our Cookie Policy for details.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="how-we-use" title="2. How We Use Your Information">
        <p>We use the information above to:</p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20 }}>
          <li>Operate the service: authenticate you, scan repositories you connect, monitor provider changelogs for breaking changes, and raise alerts.</li>
          <li>Generate auto-fix pull requests in repositories you connect and you have authorized — you remain responsible for reviewing and merging them.</li>
          <li>Send transactional email (alerts, digests, and product updates) through our email provider.</li>
          <li>Process billing if you subscribe to a paid plan.</li>
          <li>Secure the service, investigate errors, and respond to support requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not use your data for advertising.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="storage-security" title="3. Storage & Security">
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20 }}>
          <li>Data is stored in a hosted PostgreSQL database (Supabase) with encryption at rest.</li>
          <li>GitHub access tokens and provider API keys are encrypted before storage (Fernet, AES-128-CBC with HMAC); the encryption key exists only in the server environment.</li>
          <li>All traffic uses HTTPS in transit.</li>
          <li>Database credentials (service-role key) exist only on the server and are never shipped to the browser.</li>
          <li>Provider credentials are shown in the UI only as masked metadata (e.g. a short identifier), never as full keys.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="retention" title="4. Data Retention">
        <p>
          We retain your account data while your account is active. Deleting your account removes your account,
          repository connections, provider connections, scan results, and alerts. Global provider-incident records
          are not attributable to any individual user and may be retained for service operation. Records may be kept
          for a limited additional period where required for legal, accounting, or abuse-prevention purposes.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="third-parties" title="5. Third-Party Services">
        <p>We work with the following processors to operate the service:</p>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20 }}>
          <li><strong>GitHub</strong> — OAuth sign-in and repository access (including opening auto-fix pull requests only in repositories you connect, with your review).</li>
          <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — hosted PostgreSQL database.</li>
          <li><strong>Vercel</strong> — hosting for the web application and API.</li>
          <li><strong>Resend</strong> — transactional email delivery.</li>
          <li><strong>Stripe</strong> — payment processing, only if you subscribe to a paid plan.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="analytics-cookies" title="6. Analytics & Cookies">
        <p>
          We do not run third-party visitor analytics and we do not use advertising or tracking cookies.
          Authentication state is kept in your browser&apos;s local/session storage (not cookies). See our{" "}
          <a href="/cookies" style={{ color: "#635bff" }}>Cookie Policy</a> for details.

      <LegalSection id="your-rights" title="7. Your Rights & Data Deletion">
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: 20 }}>
          <li><strong>Access & correction.</strong> You can view and update your account data in the application, or request a copy by contacting us.</li>
          <li><strong>Deletion.</strong> You can disconnect repositories and providers at any time, and delete your account (which removes your data as described in section 4).</li>
          <li><strong>Revoke GitHub access.</strong> You can revoke the application&apos;s GitHub access at any time from your GitHub account settings.</li>
        </ul>

          If you are in a jurisdiction with data-protection rights (such as the GDPR or CCPA), we honour those rights:
          access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, and objection. We do not engage in automated
          decision-making that produces legal effects about you. To exercise any right, contact us using the details
          in section 9.
