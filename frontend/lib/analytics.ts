/**
 * Lightweight, privacy-friendly conversion tracking.
 *
 * No third-party analytics is currently configured for this site, so events
 * are recorded to a first-party buffer (window.dataLayer-compatible shape)
 * and mirrored to the console in development only. When a real analytics
 * provider is added (e.g. Plausible/PostHog), forward events there from
 * `dispatch()` — the call sites below won't need to change.
 *
 * Events carry NO personal information: just the event name and an optional
 * anonymous property bag (booleans/strings like which CTA was clicked).
